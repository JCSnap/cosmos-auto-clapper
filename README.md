### For Mac

Open Automator.
Choose Application when it prompts to choose a document type.
In the Actions library, select Utilities and drag Run Shell Script over to the workflow pane.

Type the following:

```
cd /path/to/your/cosmos-auto-clapper
bash run.sh
```

Remember to change the /path/to/your/cosmos-auto-clapper to the actual path where you cloned. For example: /Users/jcjustin/cosmos-auto-clapper if I cloned it into the home directory

If you are facing some error, you can try giving Automator full disk aceess in Settings under "privacy and security", you can also make sure that you have bash.

### For Windows

You can create a batch file that runs your Python script. This will be a .bat file that you can double-click to run.

Here's an example:

Open Notepad.
Type the following command: python C:\path\to\your\script.py.
Save the file with a .bat extension.
Now you can double-click this .bat file to run your Python script.
